# SupportLessons 📚💻

Welcome to the **SupportLessons** repository!

This repository is a collection of lessons, source code, and teaching materials from my work as a **Support Teacher** at an IT Education Center. It serves as a knowledge base for the topics I teach, the code written with different student groups, and various helpful resources I share along the way.

## 🧑‍🏫 About This Repository

As a support teacher, I work closely with students in various groups and help them reinforce and practice what they learn during their main courses. This repository is aimed at:

- Documenting all lessons and practice sessions.
- Sharing code samples written in class.
- Providing additional resources and links.
- Creating a reference for students to revise and continue learning independently.

## 📁 Repository Structure (Planned)


> Each group folder will include:
> - Lesson summaries
> - Code snippets
> - Homework solutions (if applicable)
> - Additional notes

## 🛠 Topics Covered

Depending on the course progress, you can expect to see topics like:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub basics
- Node.js & Express
- React (Basics to Intermediate)
- Algorithm Practice
- Project-building exercises

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is both a **learning archive** for students and a **teaching log** for myself. It helps:
- Students review past lessons.
- New teachers or assistants gain insights.
- Anyone interested follow a beginner-to-intermediate learning path in web development.

## 📬 Contributing

Currently, this repo is maintained by me to support my groups. However, suggestions, improvements, and corrections are always welcome through Issues or Pull Requests.

## 🚀 Push Summary

I regularly push updates to this repository based on:

- 🗓️ **Daily or Weekly Lessons**: Code written live during support sessions.
- 👨‍🎓 **Group-Specific Updates**: Each group will have its own folder, updated with the latest lessons and examples.
- 📄 **Notes & Resources**: Extra explanations, reference links, and optional reading materials.
- ✅ **Homework & Practice Solutions**: Sample answers and student support content.

Every push is meant to document progress and help students stay up-to-date — even if they miss a class.
